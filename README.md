# Simply CS

This repository contains the source code for my first Flutter-based app, a simple quiz application for computer science. You can download it from Google Play. The app offers quizzes on basic, difficult, or mixed computer science topics, I programmed in Dart.

Additionally, it includes my privacy policy, in compliance with Google Play's deployment guidelines.
